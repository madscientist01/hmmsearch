##Hmmer based domain search and drawing tools

###Usage

	hmmer.py -f <Files> -d <hmm database> -e <evalue cutoff> -l -o <output file> -t -i <input file>

###Options

-f, --file : List of FASTA file. MultiFasta is not supported. If files are not assigned, it assumed as *.fasta on current directory

-d --database : Hidden Markov Model (HMM) database generated by HMMER 3.0. It could be local database files name (when -l option is used), or online database file in hmmer3 web site. In the case of web service search, it should be one of these: pfam, 

-e : e-value cutoff of domain. default is 1e-5.

-o : output svg file. default is output.svg

-t : Turn off Pfam gathering threshold. it is equivalent to --cut-ga options of hmmer 3.0. if you want to search very weak similarity domains, turn off this option.

-l : Instead of web service version of hmmer3, uses locally installed hmmscan of hmmer 3.0. directory which hmmscan is resided should be in the system PATH environmental variable and hmm database name should be given by -d opition.

-i : Name of input file. Default is hmmer.INP. Using the input file, you can customize various drawing opitions.
